# HSL Map Server

A map server used to serve xyz-tiles in raster and vector formats for HSL applications.


## Endpoints

Endpoints are defined in `config.js`.

Basemap urls are:
- raster: `http://{host}/map/v2/hsl-map/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`
- vector: `http://{host}/map/v2/hsl-vector-map/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf`


The schema of vector tiles is Â© OpenMapTiles with [minor modifications](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/openmaptiles). 


## Dev server

All needed data will be downloaded inside the image during build or after startup.

Start the development server:

```
docker build -t hsl-map-server .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --name hsl-map-server hsl-map-server
```

Browse maps e.g. in the browser with the integrated map viewer:
http://localhost:8080/map/v2/hsl-map/#11/60.9823/25.6634


## Data configurations

Vector data layers are downloaded in the beginning of the image's startup command. The implementation is located under `data-fetcher` directory. Data fetcher works independently from hsl-map-server so that it just downloads data into the data directory but does not define any layers (although, the files are grouped as layers to make easier to understand which file belongs to which layer.) Data fetcher config can be found on `data-fetcher/configurations.js`. Configuration contains url from where the data will be fetched, possible graphQL query, wrangler to modify data to GeoJSON format (important for data from GraphQL) and a file name where to save the file.

Layer configurations are in `config.js`. Remember to configure the right data path to the corresponding layer.
